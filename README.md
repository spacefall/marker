# marker

A markdown-like language and parser for writing notes.
The parser can convert .mkr files to docx, html and alternatively print it to console.

### Usage
This should run on node, but it has been made using `bun init` and its default typescript options might require some tweaking to compile for node.
Once setup (with bun install, npm install, etc.), you can run the parser with `bun index.js <mkr_file>` (the file must be without extension).

### Syntax
Check example.mkr for a quick overview of the syntax and example.docx or example.html for the result.
